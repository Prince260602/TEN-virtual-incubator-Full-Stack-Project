                      When a student first approaches The Entrepreneurship Network (TEN), they should formally join the network and take part in orientation workshops to become familiar with its ideals and resources. To meet peers and mentors, they should take advantage of the tools that are available, such as webinars, online courses, and toolkits, and they should actively engage in networking activities. It's critical to establish specific goals for your business and personal life and to seek mentorship as needed. Students should work with peers to develop critical abilities, participate in practical projects and educational programmes, and get regular feedback to improve their business concepts and tactics.s
